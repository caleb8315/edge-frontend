# Edge NEW â€“ Static Website

This folder contains a lightweight static marketing website built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, inspired by your existing React components.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` directly in your favourite browser.
   
   â€¢ No build step or server is required â€“ everything is handled client-side.

2. Optional: serve the folder locally to benefit from correct MIME types and CORS behaviour.

```bash
# Using Python 3
cd egde_NEW
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Now visit http://localhost:8000

## Features

â€¢ Smooth-scroll navigation and buttons.
â€¢ Light / dark theme toggle (saved in `localStorage`).
â€¢ "AI Team" interactive cards that open modal dialogs.
â€¢ Email capture form with inline success message.
â€¢ Responsive, modern design with fluid typography and animated hero illustration.

Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
